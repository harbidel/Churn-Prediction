# Churn-Prediction
Churn Prediction using machine learning techniques such as Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier, a model for predicting churn for telecommunication businesses is proposed. On the supplied dataset, a comparison of the algorithm's efficiency is made.
# About Data
The dataset is an IBM Sample Data Sets that Kaggle created. This sample data module tracks the customer attrition of a hypothetical telco company based on a variety of parameters. The churn column shows if a customer left within the previous month. Gender, dependents, monthly charges, and several columns with information on the types of services each customer has are among the other columns.
# Outlined Process 
The following stages are used to implement the proposed Classification data analysis model:
	
•	Data collection 

•	Data preprocessing

•	Model training using diverse Classifiers

•	Results visualization
